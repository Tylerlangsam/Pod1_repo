<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2> 
<p class="blue font_calibri "> I can play six instruments. The flute, clairnet, saxaphone, trumpet, guitar, and drums. I am a huge music lover of all genres. The music I listen to on any given day is based on my feelings or mood of the moment. I love nature and the outdoors. Take me to the moutains and I will run free like a wolf. My love for the wilerness is what got me into herbs and leading me into my apothecary interest. I have always been drawn to geology and minerals, which makes since with how i love to learn about plants and the earth. My friends call me a bookcase nerd due to my copulas amount of text books. In fact I went walking along the Yellowstone River this morning and found a watermelon tourmaline in the river bed. Just in case you're wondering, yes I made a big deal about it. Hence why my friends at times can't stand me. LOL! </p>
