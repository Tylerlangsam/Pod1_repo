Question 1:
-----------
a) Briefly describe a better way of modeling genre data in the database to avoid some of the 
   issues listed above. You can assume for the sake of simplicity there can be only one genre per song. 

Create a table called GENRE. Then in it, have a column called "ID" for the primary keys 
to another column called "Genre", (that are the different types of genres in the database).


b) What relationship best describes how genre relates to songs in your answer to Question 1a? 

One to many.


Question 2: 
-----------
What changes would you make to the modeling of genre data if we could assign more than one genre to a song?

Create a table that uses foreign keys for Song and Genre.
